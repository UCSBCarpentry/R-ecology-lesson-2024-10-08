## Quarto

When writing scientific reports, RStudio IDE can effectively weave all
important components, leveraging its various tools. Quarto is a new
generation of R Markdown with backward compatibility.

It is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on
Pandoc. Like its predecessor, it is a framework for integrating code,
text, figures, citations, and more, but with the advantage of supporting
multi-language projects, more built-in output formats, and options for
customizing and create dynamic content natively in RStudio, instead of
relying on external packages.

Quarto allows you to produce research reports with minimal
reproducibility friction. It provides an environment where you can write
your complete analysis. It weaves your text, and code, and its output
together into a single document. The following sections cover examples
of how to use Quarto for exploring data with collaborators and for
communicating your science is a flexible type of document that allows
you to seamlessly combine executable R code, and its output, with text
in a single document. These documents can be readily converted to
multiple static and dynamic output formats, including PDF (.pdf), Word
(.docx), and HTML (.html).

Quarto comes pre-installed with your RStudio IDE (v2022.07 and later),
so no action is required before we can move on.

## Creating a Quarto file

To create a new Quarto document in RStudio, click File -\> New File -\>
Quarto Document:

![](fig/new-qmd.png){alt="Screenshot of the New Quarto file dialogue box in RStudio"}

Then click on 'Create Empty Document'. Normally you could enter the
title of your document, your name (Author), and select the type of
output, but we will be learning how to start from a blank document.

## Basic components of Quarto

To control the output, a YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header is
needed:

```         
---
title: "Untitled"
format: html
editor: visual
---
```

The header is defined by the three hyphens at the beginning (`---`) and
the three hyphens at the end (`---`).

In the YAML, the only required field is the `output:`, which specifies
the type of output you want. This can be an `html`, a `pdf`, or a
`word`. We will start with an HTML document and discuss the other
options later.

After the header, to begin the body of the document, you start typing
after the end of the YAML header (i.e. after the second `---`).

While we will stick to the basics, it is important to note that Quarto
provides a rich set of YAML metadata keys to describe front matter
details and configuration settings to customize how your document will
render. Even though we won't be able to cover those today, here is an
example that can inspire you to explore it further:

```

And the image below shows how this Quarto document would look like as an
html output:

## Markdown syntax

Even though RStudio supports the visual mode, through which you can
accomplish most formatting without any syntax typing. It is worth
understanding its basics.

Markdown is a popular markup language that allows you to add formatting
elements to text, such as **bold**, *italics*, and `code`. The
formatting will not be immediately visible in a markdown (.md) document,
like you would see in a Word document. Rather, you add Markdown syntax
to the text, which can then be converted to various other files that can
translate the Markdown syntax. Markdown is useful because it is
lightweight, flexible, and platform independent.

Some platforms provide a real time preview of the formatting, like
RStudio's visual markdown editor (available from version 1.4).

First, let's create a heading! A `#` in front of text indicates to
Markdown that this text is a heading. Adding more `#`s make the heading
smaller, i.e. one `#` is a first level heading, two `##`s is a second
level heading, etc. upto the 6th level heading.

```         
# Title
## Section
### Sub-section
#### Sub-sub section
##### Sub-sub-sub section
###### Sub-sub-sub-sub section
```

Ensure to only use a level if the one above is also in use.

Since we have already defined our title in the YAML header, we will use
a section heading to create an Introduction section.

```         
## Introduction
```

You can make things **bold** by surrounding the word with double
asterisks, `**bold**`, or double underscores, `__bold__`; and
*italicize* using single asterisks, `*italics*`, or single underscores,
`_italics_`.

You can also combine **bold** and *italics* to write something
***really*** important with triple-asterisks, `***really***`, or
underscores, `___really___`; and, if you're feeling bold (pun intended),
you can also use a combination of asterisks and underscores,
`**_really_**`, `**_really_**`.

To create `code-type` font, surround the word with backticks,
`` `code-type` ``.

Now that we've learned a couple of things, it might be useful to
implement them:

```         
## Introduction

This report uses the **tidyverse** package along with the *surveys_complete_77_89.csv* dataset, 
which has columns that include:
```

Then we can create a list for the variables using `-`, `+`, or `*` keys.

```         
## Introduction

This report uses the **tidyverse** package along with the *SAFI* dataset, 
which has columns that include:

- record_id
- month
- day
- year
- plot_id
- species_id
```

You can also create an ordered list using numbers:

```         
1. record_id
2. month
3. day
4. year
5. plot_id
6. species_id
```

And nested items by tab-indenting:

```         
- record_id
  + unique case number
- month
  + month case was recorded
- day
  + month case was recorded
- year
  + year was recorded
- plot_id
  + unique plot ID
- species_id
  + species alpha code
```

For more Markdown syntax see [the following reference
guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

Now we can render the document into HTML by clicking the **Render**
button in the top of the Source pane (top left), or use the keyboard
shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> on Windows and
Linux, and <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> on Mac. If you
haven't saved the document yet, you will be prompted to do so when you
**Render** for the first time.

![](fig/qmd-rendering.png){alt="The 'rendering' process"}

## Writing a Quarto report

Now we will add some R code from previous episodes, which means we need
to make sure **ggplot2** and **dplyr** are loaded. It is not enough to
load **tidyverse** from the console, we will need to load it within our
Quarto document. The same applies to our data. To load these, we will
need to create a 'code chunk' at the top of our document (below the YAML
header).

A code chunk can be inserted by clicking Code \> Insert Chunk, or by
using the keyboard shortcuts <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>
on Windows and Linux, and <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>
on Mac.

The syntax of a code chunk is:

```{r}

"Here is where you place the R code that you want to run."

```

In Quarto, you can label a code chunk by adding a label:

```{r}
#| label: testing

"Here is where you place the R code that you want to run."

```

A Quarto document knows that this text is not part of the report from
the ```` ``` ```` that begins and ends the chunk. It also knows that the
code inside of the chunk is R code from the `r` inside of the curly
braces (`{}`). After the `r` you can add a name for the code chunk. As
mentioned, Quarto is multi-language and you may enter other programming
languages for specific code chunks if desired, but since this workshop
focuses in R, let's stick to that.

Naming a chunk is optional, but recommended to easy any references and
updates you might need in the future. Note however, that each chunk name
must be unique, and only contain alphanumeric characters and `-`.

To load **ggplot2** and **dplyr** and our `surveys_complete_77_89.csv`
file, we will insert a chunk and call it 'genus-comp'. Since we don't
want this code or the output to show in our HTML document, we add an
`include = FALSE` option after the code chunk name.

```{{r}}
#| label: genus-comp
# Load necessary packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the dataset
surveys <- read.csv("surveys_complete_77_89.csv", na = "NULL")

# Count occurrences of Dipodomys and Onychomys by year
occurrences_by_year <- surveys %>%
  filter(genus %in% c("Dipodomys", "Onychomys")) %>%
  group_by(year, genus) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Plotting the data
ggplot(occurrences_by_year, aes(x = year, y = count, color = genus, group = genus)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Dipodomys vs. Onychomys by Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Occurrences") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(occurrences_by_year$year))
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Dipodomys", "Onychomys"))
```

It isn't necessary to **Render** your entire document every time you
want to see the output. For a short document it is not a problem, but if
you have many code chunks, that extra computing time can be tedious, if
you just want to check how that specific code block looks like. If that
is the case, you can run the code chunk with the green triangle in the
top right corner of the the chunk, or with the keyboard shortcuts:
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or
<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> on Mac.

Run the code chunk to make sure you get the desired output.

![](fig/genus-comp-plot.png){alt="Genus Comparision Rendered Plot Example"}

Alright, we got a rendered plot, but with a lot of extra stuff we would
not necessarily want to have in our report. Let's learn how we can
improve that.

## More on customizing chunk outputs

There are several code and cells output options that you can use to
customize how things will look like in your rendered .qmd document.
Bellow are a few of the most commonly used:

| Option    | Options                              | Output                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `eval`    | `TRUE` or `FALSE`                    | Whether or not the code within the code chunk should be run.                                                                                          |
| `echo`    | `TRUE` or `FALSE`                    | Choose if you want to show your code chunk in the output document. `echo = TRUE` will show the code chunk.                                            |
| `include` | `TRUE` or `FALSE`                    | Choose if the output of a code chunk should be included in the document. `FALSE` means that your code will run, but will not show up in the document. |
| `warning` | `TRUE` or `FALSE`                    | Whether or not you want your output document to display potential warning messages produced by your code.                                             |
| `message` | `TRUE` or `FALSE`                    | Whether or not you want your output document to display potential messages produced by your code.                                                     |
| `results` | `markup`, `asis`, `HOLD`, or `FALSE` | How to display text results. Note that this option only applies to normal text output (not warnings, messages, or errors).                            |

## More about custom code chunks

-   The default settings for the above chunk options are all `TRUE`.
-   The default settings can be modified per chunk, or across the whole
    .qmd document using the [execution
    options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html)
    at the YAML level.
-   There is also an option to apply global options to all .qmd files
    contained in a [quarto
    project](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html)
    using the `_quarto.yml` file configuration. But that is an advanced
    setup that we encourage you to explore with more time.

## Exercise

Which option would I need to apply to the \`genus-comp\` example to not
render the extra content from the plot?

::: challenge
## Exercise

Copy the code in the R script used to generate the blue graph in early
episodes below. Create a code chunk in your .qmd document, and play
around with the different options in the chunk with the code for the
table, and **Render** the document or the code chunk to see what each
option does to the output.

What happens if you use `eval = FALSE` and `echo = FALSE`? What is the
difference between this and `include = FALSE`?

``` R
`ggplot(data = complete_old, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, color = "blue")`
```

::: solution
## Solution to Exercise

Create a chunk with `{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}`, then create
another chunk with `{r include = FALSE}` to compare. `eval = FALSE` and
`echo = FALSE` will neither run the code in the chunk, nor show the code
in the rendered document. The code chunk essentially doesn't exist in the
rendered document as it was never run. Whereas `include = FALSE` will run
the code and store the output for later use.
:::

## In-line R code

We've discussed code chunks and how to include them in a QMD document,
but what if you want to integrate inline R code to present descriptive
statistics in your paper? Using inline code can enhance your narrative
by allowing dynamic values to appear alongside your text. Instead of
manually typing static values, you can call them directly from your
dataset. This way, if your data changes, the values will automatically
update, ensuring your results are always current.

To use in-line R-code, we use the same backticks that we used in the
Markdown section, with an `r` to specify that we are generating R-code.
The difference between in-line code and a code chunk is the number of
backticks. In-line R code uses one backtick (`` `r` ``), whereas code
chunks use three backticks (```` ```r``` ````).

The best way to use in-line R code, is to minimize the amount of code
you need to produce the in-line output by preparing the output in code
chunks. Let's say we're interested in presenting the average number of
rodents in our dataset.

Now we can make an informative statement as in-line R-code. For example:

Our dataset includes ``r nrow(surveys)`` cases.


becomes...

Our dataset includes `16878` cases.

Because we are using in-line R code instead of the actual values, we
have created a dynamic document that will automatically update if we
make changes to the dataset and/or code chunks. Cool, right?

::: challenge
## Exercise

..., with an average weight weight of ``r mean(as.integer(surveys$hindfoot_length), na.rm = TRUE)``millimeters.

becomes...

..., with an average hindfoot length of `r mean(as.integer(surveys$hindfoot_length), na.rm = TRUE)` millimeters.

If you feel inspired, you may also round it up ``r round(mean(as.integer(surveys$hindfoot_length), na.rm = TRUE), 2)``

becomes...

..., with an average hindfoot length of `r round(mean(as.integer(surveys$hindfoot_length), na.rm = TRUE), 2)`

## Other output options

You can convert Quarto to a PDF or a Word document (among others). Click
the little triangle next to the **Render** button to get a drop-down menu.
Or you could put `pdf_document` or `word_document` in the initial header
of the file.

```         
---
title: "My Awesome Report"
author: "Your name"
output: 
---
```

::: callout
## Note: Creating PDF documents

Creating .pdf documents may require installation of some extra software.
The R package `tinytex` provides some tools to help make this process
easier for R users. With `tinytex` installed, run
`tinytex::install_tinytex()` to install the required software (you'll
only need to do this once) and then when you **Render** to pdf `tinytex`
will automatically detect and install any additional LaTeX packages that
are needed to produce the pdf document. Visit the [tinytex
website](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) for more information.

## Note: Inserting citations into an Quarto file

It is possible to insert citations into an Quarto file using the editor
toolbar. The editor toolbar includes commonly seen formatting buttons
generally seen in text editors (e.g., bold and italic buttons). The
toolbar is accessible by using the settings drop-down menu (next to the
'Render' drop-down menu) to select 'Use Visual Editor', also accessible
through the shortcut 'Crtl+Shift+F4'. From here, clicking 'Insert'
allows 'Citation' to be selected (shortcut: 'Crtl+Shift+F8'). For
example, searching '10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4' in 'From DOI' and
inserting will provide the citation for `ggplot2` [@wickham2016]. This
will also save the citation(s) in 'references.bib' in the current
working directory. Visit the [R Studio
website](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/) for more
information. Tip: you may change citation styles automatically within RStudio.
